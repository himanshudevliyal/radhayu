Due to hygiene, safety, and quality considerations, products that have been opened, used, tampered with, or partially consumed cannot be returned or exchanged unless they were received in a damaged or defective condition. Any request for return or exchange must be reported to our customer support team within 48 hours of delivery along with clear photographs of the product, packaging, shipping label, and, wherever possible, an uninterrupted unboxing video. Requests received beyond this period may not be eligible for review.

Refunds for prepaid orders will be credited back to the original payment method within 5–7 business days after approval. The actual credit timeline may vary depending on the customer's bank or payment service provider. For Cash on Delivery (COD) orders, eligible refunds will be processed through bank transfer or any other mutually agreed payment method after the required account details have been provided by the customer. Shipping charges, Cash on Delivery charges, convenience fees, or other applicable service charges are generally non-refundable unless the refund is initiated due to an error on the part of Radhayu Herbals.",

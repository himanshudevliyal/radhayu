Once an order has been packed, shipped, or handed over to our logistics partner, it cannot be cancelled as it enters the delivery process. To request a cancellation, customers are advised to contact our customer support team as soon as possible with their order details. While we make every effort to accommodate cancellation requests, approval is subject to the current processing status of the order.",

    title: "Cancellation by Radhayu Herbals",
    body: "In certain situations, Radhayu Herbals reserves the right to cancel an order without prior notice. This may occur due to reasons such as product unavailability, pricing or technical errors, payment verification issues, suspected fraudulent transactions, incorrect customer information, or circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If an order is cancelled by Radhayu Herbals after successful payment has been received, the customer will be notified, and the applicable refund will be processed to the original payment method.",
  },
  {
    title: "Refund for Cancelled Orders",
    body: "For prepaid orders cancelled before dispatch, the full order value will be refunded to the original payment method. Refunds are generally initiated within 5–7 business days after cancellation approval. However, the time taken for the amount to reflect in the customer's account may vary depending on the respective bank or payment service provider. Orders placed using Cash on Delivery (COD) can only be cancelled before dispatch. As no advance payment is collected for COD orders, no refund process will be applicable in such cases.",

    title: "Modification of Orders",
    body: "Once an order has been successfully placed, modifications such as changes to products, quantities, delivery address, or payment method may not always be possible. Customers are requested to verify all order details carefully before completing the checkout process. If you require any assistance regarding your order, our customer support team will make every reasonable effort to help before the order is dispatched.",
